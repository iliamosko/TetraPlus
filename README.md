# In-Game Currency
TetraPlus uses P-coins as its in-game currency. P-coins are used to purchase different sounds and music, as well as different backgrounds
and Tetrimo colors/designs. 

The way that P-coins are obtained is by completeing goals/achievements while playing the game. These goals range from simple tasks like 
clearing 4 lines at once(Tetris) to doing 3 back to back Tetris clears(4 line clears). 

P-coins are also earned passively. They are awarded to you at the end of the game depending on what your score is. The higher the score,
the more coins you will get.
